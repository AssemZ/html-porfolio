 <p>This is my favourite Movie which talks about character development.</p>
    <p>
        <u>I liked one quote I heard once:</u> if you want to make a joker in the 90th, just throuh him in a pool of chemicals.<br>
        But if you want to make a joker now a days, just put him in the middle if the socity.

    <h3>Intersellar (2014) <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_inter" target="_blank">IMDb</a></h3>

 <p>Really great sci-fi movie.</p>
 <p>
    If you are a person who plot twists that make you with mixed feelings, sad and happy and even speechless,
    this movie is a great one to watch.

    <h3>Django Unchained (2012) <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_dja" target="_blank">IMDb</a></h3>

 <p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
 <p>I like this movie all because of two main things:
    <ul>
        <li>The Director (Quentin Tarantino), he has his own style with telling a love story mixed with being a superhero</li>
        <li>The performance of (leonardo dicaprio, jimmy fox & christoph waltz)</li>
    </ul>
